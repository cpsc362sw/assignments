## Description
_HRbii_ (Human Resource Business Intelligence Incrementer) is a comprehensive Human Resource management suite aimed at increasing workforce knowledge for employers and employees alike. Through the use of a centralized system, efficiency and integrity can be achieved while reducing costly human and computer error. By allowing employees to self-report personal details and self-enroll into programs with less back-and-forth communication, _HRbii_ keeps accountability and compliance at the forefront of business priorities. Both end-users and administrators benefit from the one-stop convenience and intuitive features of _HRbii_.

_HBbii_ features include:
- Time clock system
- Leave auditing
- Benefit elections by employees
- Definitions
- Payroll calculations
- Report generation
- On-boarding & off-boarding
- Information governance

## Advantages

_HRBii_ leaps over the competition with its web-based platform; users can access your organization's human resource portal anywhere, anytime, from almost any device. The back-end database architecture allows for operations of any size to benefit from its use. Administrative staff can quickly create user accounts for employees with appropriate access and modification permissions. Additional security is provided by two-factor authentication (2FA) to safeguard from external threats. Automation modules generate reports for headcount and analytics without need for intervention. Furthermore, integration with both health and brokerage organizations provides accurate and up-to-date carrier information.
